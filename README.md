# Parkour Game

This simple Parkour Game was written using Cocos2d-x and Javascript by Jason Slack (@slackmoehrle).  I've made minor adjustments to make it run on a browser.

To make the player jump you have to click the character and then swipe upwards.

This is part of a Javascript JS tutorial that he wrote available at  http://slackmoehrle.github.io/tutorials/javascript/javascript/index.html#javascript-tutorial

I strongly recommend to use Brackets as IDE for editing / running this code. You can download it from http://www.brackets.io
